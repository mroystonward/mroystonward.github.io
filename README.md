This is a personal website, blog, and portfolio for art, tech, and sonic projects by Murray Royston-Ward.

It's built using a combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) hosted via GitHub Pages.

Feel free to fork and reuse any of my code you feel useful.

If you're interested in the DAT or Tor versions of this site feel free to get in touch. At their core though they are simple mirrors of the local code. DAT simply looks at the local development folder (the _site build by Jekyll) on my laptop and syncs to [Hashbase](https://hashbase.io/) for always on p2p hosting. The TOR version is basically an RSync of the same local development folder to the site's www/ folder on a local Raspberry Pi running Tor and Nginx.
