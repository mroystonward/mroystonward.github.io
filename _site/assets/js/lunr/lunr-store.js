As it was exam time in mainstream schools I was placed in a deaf school and the workshop needed to be rapidly adapted.                                                                                              The circuitry amplifies and transforms a sound signal (such as from an mp3 player or mobile phone) to drive a piezo disc contact mic to vibrate. Attaching the piezo to a resonant object amplifies these vibrations further, in space, like a speaker. These speakers aren’t clear sound reproducers but take on resonant characteristics of the objects themselves.The vibrating piezo disc can be felt and we were instead able to work with deaf students allowing them to touch the sounds directly and through surfaces.The students built the entire apparatus themselves from components which I provided and they learned basic soldering and circuit building skills alongside creative interaction with the world around them.","categories": [],

Lou had been somewhat lazy in writing songs and Andy is expressing his Catholic work ethic.  Warhol’s Factory industrialised artistic production and attempted to dissolve the hierarchies of such labour. Despite this it was impossible for the work to escape the gravitational pull off the ‘art star’.  Recently art again attempts to play with collaboration, authorship, improvisation and non-hierarchical strategies though again it is rare for such work to escape it’s association with an artist’s name who carries cultural or economic weight.  I am interested in the art workers whose names don’t appear in vinyl lettering, who aren’t recognised in the blurb and who don’t feature on the website.  The installation by Marvin Gaye Chetwynd features the labour of a revolving cast of performers whose role is to bring the works to life for an audience.  This intervention attempts to make such labour audible and tangible, making it recognisable to the public and collectable by the institution.  A range of bands, most infamously the band ‘Lightning Bolt’, eschew the stage and play in the middle of the crowd. Born out of necessity such practice becomes a vital critique of the hierarchies of performance.  Placed on the floor, barely audible and in a transient space we return to the questionable assertion that “It’s work, the most important thing is work.”Installation Audio (excerpt)The Memory Project presents the work of students of MA Fine Art (Nottingham Trent University). During the Tala Madani and Marvin Gaye Chetwynd exhibitions, each participant transformed their own practice into an indirect form of documentation.The works act as a means of remembering these recently-closed shows.

For FOAM I chose specifically to respond to the physical aspects of the record. For side A I modified a turn-table to feedback the sounds picked up by the stylus, back into the record itself via a physically vibrating audio transducer. Manipulating the record playback and controlling the feedback system became a performative exercise exploring the record as an object.For side B I worked with micro-tonal composition and various stereo panning effects to project frequencies into space. These frequencies activate the listening space and implicate the listener, though their position and/or movements, within the the sound generating process. The sonic processes explored, such as heavily panning sub-bass, are notoriously difficult to effectively cut into vinyl. As such this was an intentional problematisation of the vinyl record by directly inviting the possibility of the failure of the medium to effectively reproduce the material.  FOAM is a peripatetic and ongoing artwork by artist Mat Jenner conceived as an enquiry into the contemporary condition of the art object and its relationship to spectatorship, dissemination and display. At the heart of FOAM is an archive of commissioned, 12” dub plate records, made and exhibited within strict conceptual parameters.  ‘Records are unique and not duplicated. They can only be listened to in situ within a physical location and are not broadcasted or digitally disseminated’  Selected artists are asked to respond to these parameters in the form of a one-off record for insertion into the growing collective body of the archive.  FOAM’s attempt at ‘resistant distribution’ aims to privilege the material qualities of each record and confers the status of art object to a media form that is, by its nature, dispersed and mass produced. the effect is to ground commissioned art works to a specific time and place, generating an insistence on a direct, physical relationship between audiences and recorded artworks.  FOAM’s format is blurred and it’s authorship indistinct. A formal reading of FOAM’s artistic proposition can simultaneously occupy different positions - encompassing expansive artwork, contemporary archive, group exhibition, curatorial frame, installation, commissioning platform, performative stage and social space. For its presentation at the attic, an additional artistic protagonist has been introduced with the aim of further blurring foam’s form and it’s multitude of authorship positions. Artist Calvin Sangster has been commissioned to design and build a new installation and structure that responds to jenner’s formal, aesthetic and conceptual brief. Sangster’s contribution sets out to provide a future structural direction for the archive and its continued evolution as it tours, and expands in size.  As part of this expansion the attic has invited artists Alice Gale–Feeny, Jenna Finch, Sebastian Jefford, Finbar and Dexter Prior, Simon Raven and Murray Royston-Ward to make new works for inclusion in the archive. These works form the basis of the next 100 artists and mark the next step in the archives development as a collective object.  During the presentation of FOAM, the ATTIC has commissioned performances by Larry Achiampong, David Blandy and Marie d’Elbee to use the space built by Sangster. Further events will be scheduled throughout the duration of the show. To mark FOAM at the attic a special limited edition 7” record by Seb Patane will be launched and available for purchase here.http://onethoresbystreet.org/portfolio/158/","categories": [],

        "title": "Self Hosting with Raspberry Pi and Tor",
        "excerpt":"A year or so ago I started experimenting with digital self publishing. Having become increasingly politicised with regard to both state and commercial online surveillance I also started questioning the role centralised platforms such as soundcloud and bandcamp play in independent music distribution. I’ll write more on this later — on motivations and failures in my critique/experience — but for now I wanted to talk about how I set up a Raspberry Pi webserver at home for publishing a Tor hidden service.My own project, The House Organ, is available on the ‘clearweb’ at https://thehouseorgan.xyz. I’ve recently moved it from github to gitlab pages and setup a custom domain for it. I’ve also maintained a Tor Hidden Service mirror of this site at tho2f4fceyghjl6s.onion/. The idea behind this is that the site would be censorship resistant and allow for visitors to connect with a degree of anonymity (I doubt that these are very high risks for me personally but there is a political spectrum here that I want to be engaged with). If you want to know more about what Tor is and how it works https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en is a good place to start. I’ll save discussion of why one would want to enagge with any of this for a later dateTo set up the Tor mirror I have setup a small webserver at home with the site proxied through Tor - all running on a Raspberry Pi.What follows are notes, self reminders and tips for trying this yourself. I made numerous mistakes on the way so feel free to ask if you encounter any problems, but at the same time this is a rather rough guide and not a step by step tutorial so treat it like a recipe that may need alterations to suit your tastes.Setting up a Raspberry PiA few notes on this:  We’re setting up in a basic headless server configuration so we’re not attaching a monitor and keyboard to interact with the Raspberry Pi. Instead we’ll login via the command line and execute commands. I found that this all took a bit of getting used to but has been useful training for working with servers in general.  For the above reasons I’d install Raspbian over NOOBS. Technically, seeing as NOOBS contains Raspbian, you should be able to do all of this with either, but you don’t need the extra bloat so I wouldn’t bother.  I’ve only done this with Raspberry Pi 2s and 3s. I don’t know if it’d work with a Pi zero and an older original Pi model might struggle a little bit if you run other services on it.  Whenever I’ve done this I’ve generally stuck to Ethernet so haven’t had to faff around much with WiFi. The transfer speeds on your local network are going to impact site load speeds over the Internet also so if you can use Ethernet do, but if not don’t worry about it.  Technically, we’re setting up a web server which probably violates your home ISP terms of service. If you started attracting much traffic your ISP might look at this more closely. Theoretically you could bump up to a business plan if needed but please just be aware of any risks you are placing upon yourself.  As you’re setting up a mini-web-server at home and exposing services to the outside world you should take precautions to ensure these don’t get hacked etc. Setting up passwordless login is a very good idea. It sounds like a bad idea but it relies on a cryptographic key for login so it’s a lot harder to hack than a password is. Setting up a firewall is essential and only expose the ports/services needed. Software such as fail2ban is worth implementing too, so as to block any suspicious activity.So, caveats and notes out of the way I’d recommend this guide - RRaspberry Pi 2: Basic setup without any cables (headless) (Wayback Machine Link as site doesn’t support HTTPS) - is easy to follow and covers basic security such as setting up a firewall and passwordless login.It’s likely getting a bit old now so do check the official Raspberry Pi guides etc. too.Installing TorFirst some more caveats. We’re using Tor to serve a webpage as a hidden service. To access these hidden services visitors need to use Tor browser. Tor browser helps with anonymity and privacy but if your use case/threat model is higher then you’ll need to look into this more deeply and make habitual changes. Also, we’re running the server from home so whilst we’re hosting a ‘hidden service’ we’re not doing it in an anonymous manner. Tor has an undeserved reputation for unsavoury and illegal activities but if you were wanting to host anything remotely illegal I don’t think hosting a hidden service at home would be a very sensible way to do it. Also, on a final note, I’m based in the UK where there aren’t currently any legal restrictions on using Tor, your local situation might differ.Right, let’s get Tor installed. We need to add Tor’s package repositories.This will open a new file for us to paste in the links.nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.listWhen I set up Raspbian it was on version Jessie so I added:deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jessie maindeb-src http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org jessie mainIf you’re on stretch etc. you can get the package details here - https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en#ubuntuctrl+x to exit and save nano.Now run these 2 commands to set-up gpg keys to validate these sources.gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -Next we need to update the package manager:sudo apt-get updateAnd install Tor:sudo apt-get install torSetting up a Hidden ServiceNow we need to configure some settings in Tor. The config file is called ‘torrc’ and is located at /etc/tor/torrcsudo nano /etc/tor/torrcUnderneath where it says:############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###You need to add (or uncomment/edit) the lines:HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:7658The first line can be any folder writable by Tor.The second line can be unpicked a bit more:HiddenServicePort 80 means that Tor will proxy to this virtual port. You could change it but I can’t think of many use cases where you’d need to so I’d stick with the standard configuration.127.0.0.1 specifies proxying internal connections. When we set up the web server this means it will proxy the sites we set up through Tor.:7658 This is the internal port we’re proxying. My web server is set to use this port. You can change this but your web server will need setting up to be the same as whatever you choose here.ctrl+x to exit and save.Now restart Torsudo service tor restartProviding everything worked and Tor restarted it will have created some files in the /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ folder.private_key is the private key pair and you should back this up and shouldn’t share it with anyone. You shouldn’t need to interact with this file though.hostname is your onion address, e.g. duskgytldkxiuqc6.onion. This is the address you’ll put into Tor browser to visit your site.The hidden_service folder is pretty locked down security wise (which is sensible) so:sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostnameTo display the onion address.Setting up a WebserverThere’s more than one way of doing this. Tor doesn’t recommend Apache as it’s a very large, complex software with a lot of potential for misconfiguration and security leaks. In our use case - a home based DIY Raspberry Pi server - I’m not sure how significant this is. Still, I opted for lighttpd as it’s fairly simple and lightweight.sudo apt-get install lighttpdI made some additional folders to structure multiple sites as follows. Replace foobar with whatever makes sense for your site name etc.sudo mkdir /var/www/htmlsudo mkdir /var/www/html/foobarNow we change the owner and permissions of the folder and add pi to the www-data group.sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/foobarsudo chmod 775 /var/www/html/foobarsudo usermod -a -G www-data piNow put your website files into the folder /var/www/html/foobarIf you don’t have any files for this yet you could make a basic index.html page:echo '&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;' &gt; /var/www/html/foobar/index.phpNow we need to edit the lighttpd config file:sudo nano /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.confchange server.document-root to (or whatever folder structure you chose):server.document-root        = \"/var/www/html\"and change server.port to the following (or whatever port you chose in the torrc config above):server.port                 = 7658Now we’re going to add our website as a virtual host. The main reason is so that we can add other sites later if we want to. Add the following lines:$HTTP[\"host\"] == \"duskgytldkxiuqc6.onion\" {      server.document-root = \"/var/www/html/foobar\"}duskgytldkxiuqc6.onion is whatever onion address you got earlier.server.document-root should point to whichever folder you created earlier and put your web files in.now restart lighttpd:sudo service lighttpd restartOpening Ports and Testing it AllEverything should now be setup but our firewall should be blocking access so we need to open up a hole in ufw.sudo ufw allow 7658This should be it, the site doesn’t need to be accessible any way other than via Tor so no other ports should need opening (though you probably opened up port 22 in the Raspberry Pi setup so as you can SSH. Make sure you keep this port open or you won’t be able to login to your Pi).Lighttpd is serving your site locally but it isn’t accessible externally.Tor however is proxying this site and serving it as a hidden onion service.Visiting duskgytldkxiuqc6.onion (or whatever your equivalent is) in Tor browser from another computer should display your website.And that’s it really. I hope it works for you as it did for me.","categories": [],

That’s often as much to do with cloudflare than captchas themselves but still…I also hate that we’re basically feeding google’s AI machine learning for free when we complete a captcha. They commercialise our browsing labour for developing the kinds of algorithms that are increasingly driving society and, in the process, driving/maintaining inequalities. Google aren’t the only ones here of course (and they’re not the only captcha system either). Smash capitalism innit :punch: 🏴Anyway. I set up comments here the otherday using staticman.

Well 48 hrs in on a super obscure little corner of web publishing and I’m already getting daily spam comments.Stuff that!So apologies to anyone who wants to comment and shares my captcha hatred but I’ve enabled google’s reCaptcha so you’re going to have to endure clicking some cars or street signs etc.Peace out :v:","categories": [],

        "title": "EOTK: Tor Mirroring on Google Cloud Engine",
        "excerpt":"So at the risk of this site mostly being tech stuff I’m posting another how-to, rough-guide, self-documentation regarding Tor.I hadn’t planned this as I’m currently a) meant to be completing a PhD funding application, b) should be trying to find a job and c) trying to focus on music related things rather than tech for a little while.Anyway,  @moananddrone got me intrigued by the Enterprise Onion Toolkit (EOTK) https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk as he’s got a project requiring it and wanted me to help look at it with him.I won’t share any details of the project as Kevin will be talking about that at some point, in the future, as appropriate.Still I wanted to share my own experiences of trying out this tool and deploying it using Google’s cloud infrastructure.There are political considerations in using Google’s (or Amazon’s etc.) cloud platforms and I’m not agnostic towards such politics. I also want to keep myself educated about the various technologies in use so this seemed like a good opportunity to test out EOTK, have a play with Google’s free introduction to their cloud services, and do all of this separately to my existing Tor installation (which works well as is — I didn’t want to risk breaking my configuration with another toolset).Google Cloud PlatformI’m not really documenting this part of the process very extensively as they’re just visual web forms which are fairly self explanatory to complete and this would just be a series of screenshots which I don’t want to do. If anyone reading struggles here though and the help pages don’t answer your questions feel free to comment and ask questions.First thing was to signup to Google Cloud Platform’s free trail - https://cloud.google.com/I then created a new project and a Compute Engine VM.I’m not 100% sure what I’m doing here but I’m trying only a micro instance with Ubuntu 16.04. I also opted for European data centres simply because European data privacy laws are generally speaking considered better that US ones (a complex and contentious issue but for my current needs this simplification is appropriate).I’m not familiar with the firewall settings here either so I’ve enabled HTTP and HTTPS. We’ll see if I need to do more config later.The online SSH client is truly impressive. Just click the SSH button/link and you get a web based terminal.Installing EOTKFirst things first:sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get dist-upgradeNow to install EOTKgit clone https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk.gitcd eotk./opt.d/install-everything-on-ubuntu-16.04.shHopefully everything is now installed.Setting up an EOTK ProjectLets try it, still in the eotk folder we can run:./eotk genThis generates an onion key file, in my case u35unrkwyvkcdxsl.key. Copy the name of this, we’ll need it in a moment.Let’s set up a configuration file. I’m going to call it mroystonward.conf but you should call it whatever you like but keep the .conf at the end.nano mroystonward.confIn the nano text editor we need to write the following:set project mroystonwardhardmap secrets.d/u35unrkwyvkcdxsl.key mroystonward.github.ioA few notes here. mroystonward is the name of my project. Use here whatever you used previously.secrets.d/ is the folder where eotk puts onion keys so this needs to stay the same.u35unrkwyvkcdxsl.key should be replaced with whatever onion key you generated above.mroystonward.github.io is the domain I’m mirroring via Tor. You should put whatever domain you want to mirror.A few notes here though. Don’t put the www hostname.You can do quite complex subdomain setups which I just don’t need in this example. Check the docs and video - here and hereFiring it upNow run (replacing the name of the conf file with whatever you chose earlier):./eotk conf mroystonward.confand (with whatever project name you chose earlier):./eotk start mroystonwardThat’s it, it’s running. We can check the status using:./eotk status mroystonwardAnd you should see both Tor and Nginx processes listed.In Tor Browser you can now visit your onion address (mine is u35unrkwyvkcdxsl.onion).Like me you probably now encounter some errors and warnings.        Your connection is not secure  SSL Certificate ProblemsThis is expected behaviour and it’s because the SSL certificates are self signed. You’ll need to click ‘advanced’ and add an exception. You may have to do this several times.There’s not a huge amount we can do about this either.Certbot/LetsEncrypt doesn’t currently support .onion domains so getting free/simple SSL isn’t an option.You currently need an SSL EV certificate which, i.e. from DigiCert, costs ~$250. For non-corporate projects this is a) expensive and b) I’m led to believe is hard to get without the proofs that accompany corporate infrastructure/incorporation etc.Depending on the nature of the site HTTPS may not be entirely necessary. This is a new area for my investigations into Tor etc. My current understanding is that the layers of encryption provided by Tor preclude the need for HTTPS on security grounds. I may be wrong here though. Feel free to comment. A HTTPS certificate does however help with proof of ownership and trust, even in an onion environment.Useful resources in starting to consider the pros and cons of HTTPS over Tor:  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/https-and-tor-working-together-protect-your-privacy-and-security-online  https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https  https://blog.torproject.org/facebook-hidden-services-and-https-certsWhat these resources don’t make sufficiently clear is the different ways one may choose to use Tor.You may use the Tor browser for increased privacy/anonymity whilst browsing clear-net websites (i.e. *.com, *.org, *.net, *.co.uk etc.). The EFF graphic describing the different levels of protection Tor and HTTPS together offer is referring to this kind of browsing. This is one reason the Tor browser includes (and benefits from) the HTTPS Everywhere plugin.You may also use the Tor browser to access .onion sites (as we’re setting up here). That this relies upon secure keys provides similar protections to HTTPS. You also know that only one site has this key and so when you connect to an onion domain it is almost certainly the site you think it is. You might not know who owns the site and they may not have your best interests at heart but it’s not anyone else pretending to be that site or intercepting traffic etc.Still, we now generally understand that when the browser gives us a security warning about certificates we should take this seriously. Encouraging users to just accept self-signed certificates isn’t good practice either.Trying HTTP OnlyIf we don’t need HTTPS we can add this line to the mroystonward.conf file:set force_https 0You’ll need to stop, rerun configuration and then start your project again:./eotk stop mroystonward./eotk conf mroystonward.conf./eotk start mroystonwardWhilst this is useful to note it doesn’t work for me as this entails downgrading from HTTPS to HTTP.But Don’t Downgrade from HTTPSWhilst I’m not yet sure of my position regarding the benefits of HTTPS over Tor for a fairly simple static website with little in the way of logins or cookies, if the original site is already HTTPS, downgrading would be considered bad practice and if there were any secure cookies and or data submission on the site we would now potentially be introducing all sorts of security holes. The EOTK developers are looking into this but for now there isn’t really any elegant solution. Tor are also considering how the Tor browser should handle onion sites with self-signed certificates.Added to this, I host mroystonward.github.io using github pages. A nice feature of this is that they enforce HTTPS. That unfortunately means that even if I set force_https to 0, the part of the process which involves github serving the clear-web site to the EOTK process is all enforced in HTTPS. That means that I’m trying to downgrade to HTTP which isn’t recommended or supported as above. There are inelegant ways around this but none that are available to me as I can’t alter how github serves it’s pages.Startup ScriptsI also faffed around for quite sometime with startup scripts via the compute engine metadata flags but I could never get everything running properly. To save you time don’t bother. Luckily EOTK comes with a handy init script tool.Run the following commands (in the eotk folder still):./eotk make-init-scriptsudo cp eotk-init.sh /etc/init.dsudo update-rc.d eotk-init.sh defaultsThat’s it, it’ll now start all projects on boot.Parting ThoughtsIt all seems very slow to me so far (and slower than a site I directly run as a Tor service from a Raspberry Pi).UPDATE: Things seem a lot faster now so my speed concerns seem mostly unfounded.I know, for example, images on the github site aren’t very optimised as a compromise for the simplicity of the static site publishing process (something I’m looking at fixing at some point). I scaled up the cloud VM to see if that made a difference and too be honest I don’t think it has so I’m sticking with the cheaper micro option for now.So, interesting exercise. If you fancy trusting my self-signed certificate you can see this in action at u35unrkwyvkcdxsl.onion. I’ll leave it running for a while and see what happens but I doubt it’ll be up for a long-long time.I’m also impressed by how easy this was to set up on a cloud platform. It suggests the possibilities for temporary set-up/use/tear-down approaches as needs fit. One could easily clone the git repo and add in some default conf files and automate the initialisation process.Also, the options to use a small cluster of RaspberryPis and OnionBalance for all of this is super intriguing too but I don’t yet have a use case for it to justify getting more Pis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNJaMNVCb-UHope this helps you have a play around too.","categories": [],

        "title": "Why Being Disconnected from Practice Isn't Really a Thing",
        "excerpt":"One hears people, especially in arts circles, talking about their relationship to practice. Artists and other creatives (not forgetting nurses, teachers and well beyond) don’t just think up ideas and they magically appear, let alone the idea that it even starts with an ‘idea’ rather than a more embedded and entwined being in the world (more on that another day). Artists do stuff and make things. Practice. Professionally though this can be a bit of stick to beat yourself with, especially if your practice isn’t very ‘visible’ or has few tangible outcomes. On a residency a while back there were several participants whose primary motivation was related to ‘reconnecting’ with their practice. But what does that actually mean?I can’t speak for others but I can speak for myself. Two years ago, following a string of post-masters projects, workshops and residencies, I lost momentum. Myself and my partner managed a little travel between my last two engagements (both residencies) and relocated to London (where we still live). During the relocation financial pressures played a significant role. I was also looking for a bit of a new challenge and started working in education. I’ll talk more about that in a moment but basically, life got in the way and I’ve done very little visible creative work.During ‘arting’ and ‘workshopping’ thoughts around pedagogy arose. It was hard to get a grip on what this actually meant to me and I felt an urge to work in education as a starting point. A range of personal experiences, and a desire to engage critically and ethically with them, pushed me towards ‘challenging’ students and so I ended up working in a PRU (Pupil Referral Unit) with socially and emotionally challenged teens. We had some ASD, various levels of SEND, frequent verbal abuse, numerous safe-guarding concerns, minor drugs issues, a bit of violence and a fair whack of property damage - all alongside some truly amazing young adults, laughs, crazy stories, amazing progress and I even got to run a little bit if a music production workshop. The first year was tough but rewarding, the second year mostly just tough. I won’t labor trying to explain this beyond what I saw as poor practice from some entrenched staff members; and a downward spiral of bureaucracy. The wider political climate is truly awful also. Not to let these factors off of the hook but also every year will be different and inevitably some things will or won’t gel better than other years. This last year wasn’t my year and it took a toll on me. Both the work demands and the emotional labor — all of which go well beyond a ‘working day’. The pay’s shit too (and I had it better than others)!I struggled to maintain recording music during this time, either collaboratively (The Sons of David Ginola’s release was from jams preceding this last year) or solo (I have recorded nothing in nearly 2 years — well except for a started but not finished possible project with yol which I failed to get off the ground in the summer holidays). My only performances of the past 2 years were Extraction Music and Electric Knife - both when we first moved. I did manage to finally sort out a range of long standing printing issues and belatedly put out some artist books, but without maintaining any kind of visible practice I may as well have been pissing into the wind.That must sound like a depressing, self-pitying, ‘negging’ though, and it is, but it also isn’t.It is because I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel some of those things. I was mostly thinking this during emotionally gruelling days where it all rubs off and gets the better of you. It isn’t though because there’s no actual yardstick by which we’re meant to measure ourselves as an indicator of success. What we actually mean when we say we’ve become disconnected from practice is that our practice has become disconnected from the systems of value and exchange frequently necessary to try and sustain practice. Often these systems are commercial and market based and the idea that our self-worth as practitioners is determined by such forces is awful and something we should actively resist.This is why I think our frequent beliefs around ‘practice’ can become a stick to self flagellate with. In my case the practice wasn’t very visible but it did exist. I have been experimenting with privacy and cryptography aware DIY digital self publishing. I have also developed a range of skills, critical understandings, ethics and approaches to teaching (whether formal or informal) — I’ve developed a pedagogy (this and the digital publishing are more interrelated than it might seem on the surface too). This is positive, this is practice, it just doesn’t look like what we’d like it to look like when we begrudge becoming disconnected from our practice. There are certainly ways to make this practice more visible, there are ways of transforming it, but those ways aren’t always practical or suit the work. We can always reflect and try better but we’re still practicing when we’re figuring this stuff out.The next challenge for me then is to try and integrate these threads of my practice and to figure out ways to make them more visible (because at some point we probably do want to connect with audiences and even the market aspects of creative practice).One step that seems important in all this is the archive. We could, but we won’t, delve very deeply into the politics and meanings of archives, rather I’d suggest that most of us try and archive our own work. Whether that be through keeping copies, scrapbooks, portfolios, meticulous documentation, backups etc. The other thing about our archives is that despite our best efforts they aren’t stable. They’re always shaped by our changing relationships to our archives. This is fairly well understood and feels pedestrian to say again but it seems to be like a good place to start to reconnect with practice (though what I really mean is to connect aspects of practice that stray from the widely accepted models of how practice should function in an arts economy and make them more visible with the ultimate aim of maintaining some kind of professional practice that may attract benefits, opportunities, kudos and payment).I’m leaving it there. Not much of a conclusion. Rather, I feel it’s more important to critically engage with what ‘being connected with practice’ really means and begin to find ways of embedding it into our praxis. The archive may or may not work for you, it may not work for me, it is where I’m starting though and I wanted to discuss why publicly.

        "title": "Testing Epoxy Backed Contact Mic's",
        "excerpt":"I’ve been making contact mic’s for myself and others for some years now (and I’m planning on putting some up for sale again quite soon so get in touch if you want any making to order). Whilst they’re very simple to make and utilise fairly cheap parts there’s a handful of variables and build options at play. There are some expensive high quality one’s on the market (Jez Riley French’s spring to mind) but I’ve always been more about durability. I want a contact mic that will take a good bashing. (This has worked well for a number of people where, e.g. they have been used to mic up a log which was being hacked at with a toy axe made from frozen piss.)I’ve tried a few variations here, especially in terms of how it is wired and where on the mic the wire is positioned. These variations, over time, have ultimately proved to be less successful than a standard wiring directly onto the piezo element. What has worked consistently well though is backing the element/wiring with epoxy resin. Often twists and snaps of the wiring are the primary site of failure and so encasing these joints in glue helps secure it. It also has the bonus of protecting the element from random shorts whilst handling etc.I want to do some comparisons with the high-end mic’s on the market at a later date (I need to buy some first) but in the meantime I thought I’d check what effects this epoxy backing actually has on sound quality/mic performance. My test was fairly simple. Two mics made from the same components (wiring, piezo elements etc.), one epoxy backed and the other bare. Here’s a picture of the set-up.        A/B Contact Mic Testing in Window with Vibration Speaker  I thought about the sound source and decided to use something pre-recorded and chose a sound collage I’d made in Iceland with a combination of piano abuse and field recordings. I thought there was a broad tonal range to help determine if there were any significant difference across the spectrum. I played this collage back using a vibration speaker placed on a wooden window bay. It was placed fairly centrally and the contact mics were an equal distance either side of the speaker. I thought the material qualities of the wood might bring out some of the bottom end and, seeing as contact mics generally don’t perform well in this part of the spectrum, I thought it would make a useful comparison.Both mic’s went into a Zoom H4n with the gain set equally. I noted at the recording stage that the epoxy backed mic was recording at a lower volume so it does already look like the resin effects sensitivity of the mic.Once recorded I imported the stereo file into Audacity. I normalised the tracks (I chose not to maintain stereo balance so L/R signal were essentially normalised independently of one another). I then split the stereo track into separate mono files. Here are those normalised tracks for you to compare for yourself.I listened back and also used Ableton Live’s built in spectral analysis. I’m a complete lay person here but have concluded the following.I couldn’t spot any discernible difference in frequency response. There are obviously minor differences as the 2 tracks do sound slightly different. I couldn’t however isolate any areas of the audio spectrum where the epoxy backed mic performed worse than the unbacked mic.As noted above, the backed mic was slightly less sensitive. This means that when it was normalised the noise floor would have been amplified slightly too. Usually this wouldn’t present a significant issue as we’d simply raise the sensitivity of the recorder. I couldn’t do this for the purpose of testing but, if I was setting the recorder to the appropriate level for the mic, normalisation wouldn’t have increased the volume as much or any background preamp noise.As to the qualitative differences. Well, I can’t quite put my finger on it. I think the higher and lower ends perform very similarly. Instead, I have a theory. I think there are some resonances in the unbacked recording that aren’t very strong in the epoxy-backed recording. I think that the piezo element has natural, material resonances itself. These elements are initially designed to act as buzzers so there is a natural frequency at which they will oscillate and self-resonate. When the piezo element is distorted by vibrations it generates an electrical signal and this is what we hear when we record it and play back through a loudspeaker. I think that these self-resonances, the material properties of the piezo element, are shaping the recording slightly and that this is the difference we hear. The epoxy resin backing suppresses the distortion of the piezo element. This makes it a little less sensitive to vibration but also suppresses the resonant properties of the piezo element.Practically speaking my interpretation is that the epoxy backed contact mic is a little quieter when recording so needs a little more gain. It performs equally well across the frequency spectrum (within the general limitations of a contact mic’s frequency response). The material resonances of the piezo element are somewhat suppressed. What the suppression of those resonances actually means is quite subjective. Suggesting one is more ‘honest’ is quite ridiculous as any recording/listening process is far from ‘neutral’. For general purpose I think I prefer less of those resonances. For others they may be preferable. I could certainly see making work specifically addressing those resonances.The purpose of this experiment though was to understand what difference epoxy backing made and to determine whether it had particularly negative or unfavourable consequences. I feel I can confidently say they perform as well if not better with the caveats of personal preference/context regarding resonance.","categories": [],

        "title": "Onionised Bandcamp",
        "excerpt":"I’ll cut to the chase, I’ve ‘Onionised’ Bandcamp.If you want to see it in action it’s here bandc2v6rbqrn6vx.onion (You need the Tor browser to visit .onion links - https://www.torproject.org/)A word of warning though, you need to jump through some hoops due to HTTPS over Tor. If you know what you’re doing check out this ‘landing’ page - https://gist.github.com/mroystonward/aec1fa678186fe62c692b1d5b9d129c2 / bctorowb7blvvryo.onion - if not, read on.        Bandcamp Onion Address in Tor Browser  Platforms, Surveilance and Commercialisation of Data  Independent artists, punk labels, and do-it-yourself (DIY) organizers have long suggested that the means through which music is created and distributed carries as much political weight as the content of the songs—by subverting the status quo, making their own platforms, and creating alternative worlds.  What do these ideologies mean in today’s hyper-mediated, corporate digital culture? New enemies of agency now surround music communities in the form of centralized and exploitative platforms that musicians and listeners increasingly grow beholden to.(https://shadowproof.com/2017/11/01/protest-platforms-resonate-streaming-co-op-agency-to-artists/)Many platforms are exploiting your ‘content’ for corporate, commercial advantage. Driving engagement to maximise advertising revenues served alongside your work. Tracking and harvesting massive troves of data to train AI algorithms which can later be commercialised further or just selling it on via data-brokers. The political/societal ramifications spread wider, just consider the dynamics of power and capital associated with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica’s role in Brexit/Trump victories (consider the various investigative links here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica#Criticism).The terms are frequently inequitable for artists (i.e. Spotify streaming payment rates) yet there seem to be few viable alternatives for engaging with audiences and the successful platforms have monopolised their spaces with little room for small independent publishing. Rather, the only way to ‘compete’ is to go in and ‘disrupt’ with rounds of angel backing to try and build something even bigger (though this pessimism is somewhat disingenuous as I do believe that collectively we can build better systems).Some of the worst excesses of such platforms seem to be thankfully absent from Bandcamp. They’re not profiting from advertising alongside your content and instead it’s in their interest to drive your sales for their business model. They’re not claiming undue license over the work you put online through their platform. Their fees certainly don’t seem unreasonable. PWYL embodies a tension along a continuum of exploitative benefits to the platform from music moving around itself easily and freely vs. an artistic desire to make sounds available widely and to try and engender forms of sharing and ‘patronage’ rather than a pure sales focus. There are options and consent (though sometimes requiring a premium subscription for maximum control over one’s own work within the limited options given by the platform).Bandcamp does however use Quantcast tracking and Google Analytics. I won’t labour this other than to say that Google Analytics, for most average users, is probably not of concern (however there should be broader public debate on the implications of state level surveillance programs and their access to such data), whereas Quantcast provide machine learning, demographic tracking and shopping insights etc. (https://www.quantcast.com/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantcast). I don’t know ‘how’ Bandcamp is using this. It may be driving recommendations (which for many has tangible benefits to ‘us’ as well as ‘them’) or other insights for optimising the platform. It may be part of a much larger data gathering exercise that provides Bandcamp with additional revenue. Either way, our browser activity is being tracked and commercialised both as ‘artits’ and ‘fans’ and the equitability of this relationship is unclear.I don’t know about how and how much Bandcamp engages in forms of censorship. They presumably have to deal with copyright infringement, issues around free and hate speech, they may have to engage different filtering depending upon geopolitical requirements. I can’t say I’ve heard about blocking, banning, spam etc. on Bandcamp the way it pervades other platforms and networks. That this could be done though still enters into the debate I wish to raise.  Beyond a certain tipping point, platforms become difficult not to use. All this means that power, and a conservative form of power at that, is deeply involved in platforms within the human world. But I think it is also important to emphasize that the reason platforms become successful is partly because they enable you to do things; they are productive, generative. Those seeking to oppose a given platform—a technical one, like Microsoft, Google, or Apple, or a political one, like Neoliberalism, or an aesthetic one, like conservative genre boundaries or tuning systems—have to remember that. It implies that a purely negative or transgressive project will be unlikely to be able to seriously disrupt the functioning of existing malignant platforms. Only the building of new, better ones, will suffice. Or perhaps the re-engineering of those already in existence.(http://www.glass-bead.org/article/reengineering-hegemony/ - note Internet Archive link due to source not being available via HTTPS)I say all this because the desire to ‘onionise’ Bandcamp isn’t one of being anti-Bandcamp. Rather it’s one of engaging with broader debate and scrutiny around content/market/social platforms, especially as they relate to power dynamics in publishing and sharing creative content.

Whilst it is talked about and useful in terms of resisting state level surveillance it has a longer history in resisting corporate surveillance (and an even longer history in secure military communication). One can use Tor to browse relatively anonymously (this claim comes with caveats about browsing habits and online behaviour), securely and privately. It is also relevant in terms of censorship circumvention and network resilience.This won’t be a technical primer about Tor and it’s benefits/risks. It is perfectly legal to use here in the UK but your local jurisdiction may differ. Along with the many positive uses of Tor it has been, and continues to be, used for illegal marketplaces.

Related to this work @moanandrone has, quite exceptionally and it will be interesting to see the longer-term impact of this project, gone on to ‘onionise’ the University of West London Repository and his documentation offers some valuable insight as to how issues of intellectual freedom and centralised platforms effect scholarly work - https://moananddrone.github.io/bag-of-onions.If you are interested in how to use EOTK yourself the above links should be helpful.        By Unknown or not provided  Retouched by Mmxx [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons  Decentralisation and AlternativesDecentralisation continues to offer strong alternatives to current calcifications of power. Opportunities have spread far beyond p2p file-sharing and torrents. The potential demise of Soundcloud last year raised 2 particularly interesting responses.  Soundcloud is a good example of a project with modest ambition gaining traction with subcultures who then elevate it to a place of relevance. As that growth is recognized, the gears of homogeneity start to turn, and the intent shifts from being one of creating something interesting to creating something larger.https://jon-kyle.com/entries/2017-08-19-platform-death/Jon Kyle and the DAT community offered a Soundcloud archive tool (to preserve your tracks should the service shutdown) that would be served and hosted using p2p. I made an archive here - dat://5525a6916dbed65eb9ea8d1fe7501cda094f937ec7b674337e038dc8427077fd/ (you need Beaker Browser to view). Projects like ZeroNet and OpenBazaar are also viable alternatives.  Many factions of the independent musical infrastructure have become closer and closer aligned with corporate interests and advertising supported journalistic models in order to keep their head just slightly above water, and are in danger of losing their distinction and identity as a result. Unless we construct an intervention, this curve towards the commercially viable and mediocre templates of the bland, centralized, content warehouses ultimately threatens to displace the role of music as the preeminent critical space of psychedelic possibility, experimentation and collective desire.https://medium.com/blockchannel/soundcrowd-tokenizing-collectivizing-soundcloud-5c4f60ed4961Elsewhere Matt Dryhurst suggested tokenising Soundcloud using blockchain technology to engender decentralised, collective ownership. His article is well worth a read and it raises numerous salient points. I would add to my general enthusiasm towards his suggestions that the crypto/blockchain space has a number of inherent issues that need to be resolved. Not only has ‘mining’ proved incredibly resource inefficient there are fundamental ‘oracle’ problems in ‘smart contracts’ which undermine the decentralisation possibilities. And that’s ignoring the general hyperbolic bubble surrounding such technologies. Still as a model for possible collective ownership there’s a lot of potential.There’s no reason why similar considerations couldn’t also feature in the ongoing development of Bandcamp or other such marketplaces. These aren’t systems of intervention we can easily implement within the platform though. We either set up alternatives (set up our own p2p archives etc.) or we take over the platform (tokenising Soundcloud would likely take the form of ‘buying it out’ and distributing it equitably).        By Zeynel Cebeci (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons  Bandcamp OnionFor now we aren’t looking to immediately replace or change Bandcamp (or Soundcloud etc.). We are looking to ensure that, as a platform, it offers opportunities to publicise our music without sacrificing the broader privacy of ourselves or our fans.Some of these benefits could be garnered through simply accessing the existing site using Tor browser and, in combination with HTTPS, we would experience improved privacy from various forms of tracking. Onion Services however improve anonymity/privacy even further and so I’d like to see more platforms, such as Bandcamp, embracing these positively (much as Alec Muffett has done with Facebook).Onionising Bandcamp is a provocation: it aims to gauge interest in using such a platform in this manner; it hopes to further debate around the role platforms play in music publshing and consumption; and it intends to show Bandcamp their onionised site in action in the hope they would implement it officially.The biggest problem with this implementation is to do with the way browsers handle HTTPS certificates. The EOTK proxy generates self-signed certificates which generate warnings..onion domains don’t require HTTPS as the layers of encryption already present in the Tor network infrastructure offer greater security. The only real use for HTTPS with a .onion domain would be in cases of public sites also offering onionised versions and demonstrating ownership. In such cases the site would procure a signed certificate for the original site and the onion version.As I don’t own Bandcamp and am simply proxying it through Tor I have no claim to ownership. If anything what I am doing is unauthorised. I can not, and would not, provide a signed certificate for HTTPS.The implication is that it is necessary to allow these security exceptions as you browse. Where images, CSS and JS etc are handled by various CDN domains it becomes necessary to allow several exceptions for the site to simply display properly.If Bandcamp implemented a .onion domain themselves, with an appropriate HTTPS certificate, this game of certificate whack-a-mole would become unnecessary.The main Bandcamp Onion is available at bandc2v6rbqrn6vx.onion.If you want the site to function correctly though I would recommend pre-authorising several domains as listed here (or bctorowb7blvvryo.onion)Performance may vary and the current implementation isn’t setup ‘yet’ for scale. I’ll update this page as necessary and if Bandcamp respond to the provocation.Update - 2018-02-16: Yesterday I tweeted about this experiment and in one of those tweets I thanked Alec Muffett for the EOTK tool. This led to an exchange which addressed issues of consent.I wanted to update this post to reflect this exchange and have chosen to do so as an addition to the end of the article.There was some positive and useful engagement from Alec who is deeply experienced in this field. It will certainly help to shape communication with Bandcamp.The language of consent and dating/flirting, suggestive of sexual conduct, was also used and Jacob Applebaum was specifically mentioned along with a project he, and others, were involved in called ‘onionflare’. I was unaware of this project before this exchange and only really knew of Applebaum in relation to publicity surrounding acts of sexual abuse. I am also aware of the harm that these actions, and other similar cases of abuse and misogyny, have caused. Not being part of the communities affected I don’t feel there’s anything I can add beyond general disgust in his conduct and solidarity with his victims.I don’t want to avoid the issue of consent in this context as it does raise ethical issues that should be part of the discussion. I myself alluded to this early on in the post, specifically in reference to Bandcamp generally acting consentingly in their approach to artist’s uploaded content. I also mentioned later on that I didn’t do this with permission and that it was likely to be considered ‘unauthorised’. I had considered therefore that Bandcamp may not view this provocation kindly and may even go as far as to send some kind of cease and desist.Picking up on the use of the word ‘provocation’ it may suggest causing agitation carrying negative connotations. I want to highlight the arts context from which I have come where such a provocation is frequently framed as a positive intervention to spark critical engagement (for further context: the department where I studied has been pioneering aspects of an arts based critical pedagogy, drawing from Freire and Illich, that frequently used ‘provocations’ in lieu of traditional lectures). The idea here then isn’t to provoke Bandcamp to piss them off, but to provoke some of the Bandcamp community into critical engagement. I feel that parts of the original post regarding not being ‘anti-Bandcamp’, and the quote regarding the futility of purely transgressive responses to platforms of power and hegemony, provide the necessary context for such a reading of provocation but perhaps it is worth spelling it out more clearly.There are important reasons why onionising sites in this manner would be problematic. Not least the trust model of accepting self-signed certificates would likely be damaging in a long-term outward trajectory. There are complex configurations of power inherent in large platforms but there are still sysadmins and technical apparatus being deployed to ensure system integrity for our benefit as much as the platform’s (and in many ways we make the platform so simple us/them dichotomies don’t do these issues justice). Maverick actions which undermine such systems efforts are also potentially damaging. If there was the interest and use-case for an onionised Bandcamp (a question I hope this project is attempting to explore) these considerations stack up to compelling reasons Bandcamp should consider implementing this officially. In the meantime though this could be considered a threat to Bandcamp’s system integrity.There is also a complex history of Tor, the unfairly monikered ‘Dark Web’, Hacktivism and criminal activity that means that it is in the wider community’s interest to tread lightly, respectfully and in friendship. This should also exist alongside personal empowerment to challenge large hegemonic power structures though. This is the main reason why I don’t see the link with ‘onionflare’. I’m in no way proposing forcibly onionising the web with this project, I’m proposing we raise the level of discussion around power and privacy in relation to DIY online publishing and the platforms which dominate these activities. I’m also doing this on a small scale as an individual. I’m not wielding the power of a community or organisation to try and force others into Tor adoption.Perhaps a bigger challenge is the way, through onionising Bandcamp, I have drawn the labour of others into this project. From the design, coding and assets of the website (not to mention the labour in maintaining and supporting it), to the artwork and music of the many, many artists using the platform. This is an aspect that interests me significantly and I’m glad of the opportunity to raise it. The ethics of plagiarism and unauthorised use of my own work have affected me personally in an arts project I was deeply involved with some years ago. I have also previously made work based upon the uncredited, volunteer labour present in a major exhibition of an internationally renowned artist.The nature of proxying a website via EOTK makes it hard to fathom the relationship this has to the use of licensed works. The onion service is simply a gateway to the originating website that exists on the Tor network. Your web request goes to the onionised site, this requests the content from the originating site and then serves it back to you. When we put our content on Bandcamp (or other platforms) we have little to no say about how it is transmitted over network infrastructure. We cannot stipulate that we only want our work transmitted over a specific protocol, or that our work is never transmitted over communication lines in a particular geo-location, or through a particular ISP. We can’t for example stipulate that our work is only transmitted over HTTPS and that it isn’t transmitted over communication lines in Manchester or owned by BT. Whilst it would be a nightmare to implement perhaps we should be asking for that kind of control! These issues are not entirely unrelated to those explored by Saga though I’m describing a more extreme network infrastructure idea than the original platform based one.Irrespective of such technical concerns, if you have music on Bandcamp it is now drawn into the frame of this project whether you like it or not. That may be acceptable in terms of not having or expecting control over the technical infrastructure of your work being served by Bandcamp but it isn’t entirely ethical of me either. It’s such grey areas which are at the heart of Pirate Bay claiming no wrong-doing as they’re not ‘hosting’ illegal content or that google/youtube probably provide access to more illegal content than any ‘pirate’ site. I really don’t know how I feel about all of this. If someone actively objected to the appearance of their work within this project I know I couldn’t achieve the level of granularity to exclude them and that makes me uncomfortable.I don’t know whether all of these aspects were what Alec was thinking about with his responses but I do hope my comments help ensure that relevant issues are adequately present in any ongoing debate this provocation may raise. Comments are open so it would be great to hear other opinions.","categories": [],

        "title": "Testing Impedance Matching Contact Mic's",
        "excerpt":"I’ve been thinking about and comparing contact mic’s recently for a combination of reasons. Firstly I have some broad assumptions that I’ve never really tested and secondly I’m curious as to how the ones I make stack up against other offerings. What makes a difference in a contact mic and how much difference does it really make?Previously I’ve compared how much difference backing my contact mic’s with epoxy resin (to make them more durable) makes to their performance - https://mroystonward.github.io/epoxy-backed-contact-mics/.The piezo-electric elements used in building contact mic’s are very high impedance and so various methods of matching, buffering and pre-amplifying the signal are recommended. I decided to buy and test an Hosa MIT-129 Impedance Matching Transformer.I tested at work on a metal-clad table using some rulers and sellotape to generate sounds for recording. The mic’s were placed roughly equidistant from the sound source.        Impedance Matching A/B Contact Mic Testing with Twangers and Sellotape  The sounds are a procession of ruler ‘twanging’, scraping and sellotaping. An image of the set up is above and the sound recordings are below (you can download from soundcloud too for your own analysis if you like).I listened back and also used Ableton Live’s built in spectral analysis. I’m still a complete lay person here but have some conclusions.        Impedance Matching A/B Contact Mic Analysis  In the image above I’ve highlighted 3 areas on the spectral analysis with the following thoughts:  A. The unmatched input shows a peak of activity below 20Hz. I’m surprised and confused by this. Firstly this kind of response at low frequencies is unexpected with a basic contact mic with no buffering/matching/etc. Secondly, this is below general human hearing and has little to no impact on the perceivable audio performance. I’m not saying these frequencies are meaningless (they undoubtably are part of the signal and potentially influence the perceptible frequencies) but simply, in cases such as this, don’t appear to be significant. I expect that there are perfectly reasonable electrical-engineering reasons for this but I’m still rather surprised.  B. Without impedance matching the contact mic is fairly unresponsive around the 80-90Hz range. This is likely part of where contact mic’s are considered to perform weakly with low frequencies.  C. The unmatched mic has several weak points throughout the 200Hz-2.5kHz range. This again weakens the low to mid range response and robs the recording of some richness. Said richness is present in the impedance matched recording along with generally improved low-mid frequency response.Below is another screenshot from later on in the track and again we see similar results.        Impedance Matching A/B Contact Mic Analysis  There are further, qualitative differences that I think are worth consideration.  Firstly, the unmatched contact mic bristles with a little something not present on the other channel. As with the epoxy resin comparisons I think this is related to the resonant frequencies of the contact mic itself and I think that these are attenuated by the impedance matching. Whilst that little bit of extra energy might be desirable in certain situations (I’m primarily thinking noise-music type applications) if you’re after more ‘audiophile’ results it’s worth investing in an impedance matching adaptor.  Secondly, the impedance matching transformer reduces the overall recording amplitude slightly. The tracks were normalised but no further edits/processing was undertaken. If I boost the volume on the 2nd channel the noise floor comes up with it (and apparently Zoom H4s can be a bit noisy anyway). This isn’t really a problem. When recording using impedance matching transformers we could raise the input sensitivity so the recording wouldn’t be quieter and it wouldn’t need a boost which brings the noise floor with it. As much as the slight ‘bristling’ mentioned above is possibly linked to resonance, I think the recording volume differences also play a small part. The moral of the story here is simply that I could have gotten a slightly better recording via the matched channel if it wasn’t for the controlled variables of the A/B comparison.That’s it really, these strike me as the most significant comparisons/differences. Again, I’m quite pleased as to how well an epoxy-backed, unmatched contact mic stacks up in general and would recommend anyone without the budget to invest in more expensive pro-mic’s and additional equipment to get stuck in and have a go. I’m also pleased with how well an impedance matching adaptor complements a relatively cheap contact mic. I paid ~£16.50 for the adaptor which, considering how much use I’m likely to get out of it, seems pretty good value. I’ll probably get a second one at some point so I can use them on both channels on my audio recorder or even use them for live work.","categories": [],
