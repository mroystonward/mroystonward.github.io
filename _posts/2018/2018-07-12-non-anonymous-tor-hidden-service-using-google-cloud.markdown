I've previously talked about how to set up Tor Hidden Services at home on a Raspberry Pi. As I'll be moving around soon and not have a permanent base to run such a mini-server I have been thinking about what to do.

One option would be to take it with me and run it as a portable, nomadic server. This is appealing on several fronts but not practical for me right now as under some circumstances encryption technology and the use of Tor is highly scrutinised and problematic. Whilst I'm simply self-hosting and publishing my own music therefore acting perfectly legally not everywhere see's it that way and unwanted scrutiny of myself might jeopardise the projects of others I will be associated with. This is all probably a little extreme but it's not a risk I'm currently able to take.

Another option would be to have a friend or family member take on the little server. Whilst this is feasible it's not what I want to do right now. Especially because having to ring someone up and ask them to reboot it if there's a problem is fine if that works first time, if troubleshooting becomes more difficult it can become a burden.

A third option would be to simply cease running the hidden service for a while. Not what I want to do.

Finally then, I need to move from the small home-based server to another hosting solution. I could rent server space, set up a VPS etc. or, and I'm a curious fan of this at the moment, play with so-called 'cloud' solutions.

This is problematic. My desire to publish independently in a way that critically engages with the economies of 'platforms' will now rely on the infrastructure of some of the largest and richest private companies in the world and be embedded with their numerous disturbing business practices and lines of money/power.

I still have free trial credit with google though that I would like to use up and at this stage, as a learning exercise I feel that engagement with these platforms in such a way is beneficial. It helps me to develop technical skills and knowledge, by reporting this way I can also help share this knowledge. Whilst, ideally, at some point I would move these services again, to somewhere less problematic, for the meantime it's a simple solution to my problem.

So... onwards.
