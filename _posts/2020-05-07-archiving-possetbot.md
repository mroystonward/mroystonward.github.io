I've just archived the 'Joe-Posset-Review-AI' ([see this write-up](https://radiofreemidwich.wordpress.com/2018/09/25/the-death-of-music-criticism-cheap-artificial-intelligence-quickly-assimilates-the-rfm-undead-into-weird-new-shapes-creating-a-confident-chrome-voice-that-it-will-use-to-crush-destroy-each-sorr/)), otherwise know as 'Posset-bot', [repository](https://github.com/mroystonward/Joe-Posset-Review-AI).

Some system updates broke things locally. Google have significantly upgraded TensorFlow and the scripts I hacked are no longer compatible.

I've wasted a good few hours trying new installs and adapting the scripts to no avail.

I'm sure it's fixable but it's not a good investment of time just for some tongue-in-cheek fake reviews over at [The House Organ](https://thoughouseorgan.xyz).
