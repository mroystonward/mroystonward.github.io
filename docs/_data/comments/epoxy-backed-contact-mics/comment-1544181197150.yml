message: "Thanks for commenting Tom,\r\n\r\nGlad to find that others draw similar conclusions. I hadn't come accross Zach Poff's approach but I like what I've read so far.\r\n\r\nYes, you're quite right about the impedance mismatch and I see you found my experiences with the Hosa transformer after this.\r\n\r\nOne of my main ambitions has been to test against some other, more established brands (i.e. Cold Gold and JrF) but I've not had any spare money to attempt this yet.\r\n\r\nI've also been increasingly keen to try sheilding my mics, much as you mention. When I get around to trying this I'll post the results.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading."
