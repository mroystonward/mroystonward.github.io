message: "I should've read this article before commenting on your epoxy experiment! Glad you found the HOSA and took it out for a spin (so to speak).\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that some of the resonances in the un-epoxied mic were tamed by the HOSA. I need to pull mine out and play with that. I'm curious if the Stompville preamps have a similar effect.\r\n\r\nAlso, what you found about the MIT-129 reducing the overall signal coming out of the piezo element lines up with what I found as well. You lose something going through the transformer. That was another thing I liked about the Stompville amplifiers. They come out more or less 1:1 with a bare piezo. When I first built mine I was using a Tascam DR-70D. A little quieter than the Zoom  H4, but still not the quietest inputs in the world. One of the reasons I opted for the Stompville amps was that I didn't want to have to increase the gain on my recorder.\r\n\r\nThanks again for writing these articles!\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nTom"
