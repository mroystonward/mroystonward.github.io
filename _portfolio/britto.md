A Triangle Network Fellowship at Britto Arts Trust in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2015

{% include gallery id="britto" %}

Exploring improvised ‘musicking’ and socially engaged arts practices I made a number of improvised performances and recordings. I presented this work on national television and worked with Dhaka Electronic Scene to develop workshops, performance and investigations into 'narrative' soundworks.

I also undertook citizen noise level readings as part of a critical investigation into 'noise' and its cultural interconnections.

Much of this work is collected in this artist's book - [My Neighbor Who Lives in the City of Mirrors near My House](https://mroystonward.bigcartel.com/product/my-neighbor-who-lives-in-the-city-of-mirrors-near-my-house-artists-books-cd)

{% include gallery id="book" %}

As part of the residency I also connected with the local arts community by running a series of open forma and collaborative ‘Listening Groups’ with the intent of encouraging philosophical and personal discourses around sound and music - both in a Fine Arts context and where they intermingle with ‘popular music’.

All listening group materials are archived here: [https://mroystonward.gitlab.io/Britto-Listening-Group/](https://mroystonward.gitlab.io/Britto-Listening-Group/)
