10 week UNIT(e) Residency at g39 in Cardiff.

{% include gallery %}

For UNIT(e) I wanted to take the installations Iâ€™d previously been working with out of the gallery and into the community. Portable and battery powered.

I experimented with circuitry to connect memories and spaces from previous projects to new locales and situations through temporary and portable sound installations.
