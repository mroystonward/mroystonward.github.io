I was asked to play at From Now On and I suggested a hybrid installation/performance which built upon my work with transducers. As an extended 4 hour piece the audience drifted in and out as I sporadically tweaked, tuned, and interfered with the work. Several drums, spread around a darkened room, with DIY vibration transducers attached, I routed various live sounds and field recordings from past projects to create a layered, slow-moving, audio collage. I also placed objects upon the drum heads to modify and interact further with playback, sometimes utilising feedback paths, and elsewhere allowing rice and chains to vibrate and rattle.
