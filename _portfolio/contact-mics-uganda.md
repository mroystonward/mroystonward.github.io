A 2 day workshop ran in the Katwe slums of Nsambya in Kampala, Uganda during December 2013.

Participants built contact mics learning basic soldering. We also branched out into wiring audio cables and other connectors.

We then went out into the community with our mics and an audio recorder documenting and intervening as we went. The participants learned how to use recording equipment and how to interrogate their environment from new perspectives.

In the final stage of the project we mixed our recordings to create a sound collage as a kind of postcard exploring identity and environment.
