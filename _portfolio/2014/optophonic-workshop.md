I was invited to run a workshop as part of PS2N’s Optophonic Workshop.

{% include gallery %}

We built the same amplifier box and contact mic with transformer combination as used in Rainforest IV. This was a development of the Transducer workshop as originally conceived for Nepal.

Participants learned soldering and circuit building skills as well as getting to take home some audio hardware that they could use with other skills and equipment encountered throughout the days activities.
