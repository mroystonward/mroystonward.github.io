Sound installation and score drawing upon the alternative tuning systems of La Monte Young and the musical legacy of Sunny Murray.

{% include gallery %}

Triangle waves based upon La Monte Young’s ‘Well Tuned Piano’ interact in space creating harmonic fluctuations around the room. Inspired by Sunny Murray’s cymbal techniques these harmonics are set up in the space to be punctuated by percussive accents.

The harmonic frequencies are chosen to create the possibility of an ecstatic response, channeling the emotional powers activated through Free Jazz and Fluxus era composition. The environment directly implicates the listener’s physical presence with tones shifting in relation to one’s movements and position.
