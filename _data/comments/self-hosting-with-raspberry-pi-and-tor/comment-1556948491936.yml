  The amount of memory is not what is holding back the rPi 3 from rendering web
  videos quickly.  It is the fact that through the JavaScript, it must software
  render.  When you combine youtube-dl and omxplayer, the rPi 3 can play youtube
  vids at 1080p through its GPU with no problem.  You can also get Chromium to
  run on raspbian, but I do not have a speed comparison with ChromeOS.
