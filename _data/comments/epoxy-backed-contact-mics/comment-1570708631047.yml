message: "I just read this after trying a quick test of a contact mic with shielded cable etc plugged into my Stompville box and a second-hand MIT-129, using the XLR inputs of an H4N.\r\n\r\nOn first impression the sound quality is decent enough through the MIT-129, but the output is very quiet.\r\n\r\nWith recording level set to 100, I could barely make out the rattles and bumps in a tree outside as it moved in a breeze.\r\n\r\nThe Stompville box was much louder. Neither was as loud  as a 'raw' mic plugged directly into the jack socket.\r\n\r\nI really need to set up a consistent sound source and look at the spectrograms from direct jack connection vs the two impedance matching devices."
