My work addresses improvisationâ€™s core materiality by interrogating agential relationships between humans and objects/materials through creative activity. I use audio technology, material resonance, and feedback in improvisatory relationships with materials, to extend notions of 'doing' music through, building instruments for improvisation and exploring the entanglement of human and material in practice.

I have worked with national and international arts organisations on workshops and projects that successfully expand improvised music practices into the visual and participatory. I have also exhibited visual arts, sonic installation, and large scale audio-visual performance events. In 2015 I received a Gasworks International Fellowship awarding me an 8 week residency at BRITTO Arts Trust in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I am also deeply involved in the UK Do-It-Yourself scene for experimental music as a promoter, performer, writer, and publisher.
